# Ideas Guidelines
September 07, 2025 â€” Owner: [Your Name]

## Status system
- ðŸ”´ Exploring: hypothesis; shaping problem and outcome
- ðŸŸ  Drafting: brief exists; scope, impact metrics, approach defined
- ðŸŸ¢ Validated: evidence accepted; ready to use or promote; designate canonical
- ðŸ”µ Promotedâ†’(Strategy|Execution): moved out of Ideas; Ideas keeps a pointer
- âšª Mergedâ†’ID-XXX: combined into another idea; keep pointer only
- âš« Archived (reason): closed; keep evidence links for traceability

## Row fields
- status: bracketed emoji status, e.g., `[ðŸŸ¢ Validated]`
- tags: short topical labels for filtering
- badge: ðŸ“Œ Canonical cue when a canonical doc exists
- canonical: single source-of-truth file path
- evidence: supporting sources and references
- related: adjacent resources
- promoted: target docs after promotion
- what/origin/purpose/milestone/next: optional clarity fields

## Canonical rules
- Layers 01â€“04 are canonical for their scope.
- 05-research may mix canonical/non-canonical; mark canonical in front-matter and reference from Ideas.
- Canonical at Drafting is optional; at Validated it should be set.
